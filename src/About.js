        <p>A little about me and this app - I am currently a student, learning the ends and outs of full stack software engineering. I am greatly interested in cryptocurrencies and blockchains in general, so I figured creating this app would be a great way to get experience with React frontend as well as dipping my toes in ways that I can help push the defi movement further. I hope you enjoy! <br></br> - Ford

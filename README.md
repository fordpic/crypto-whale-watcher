# Description

This application pulls DeFi data from the Coingecko API and displays the top 100 coins by market cap in real time, along with dedicated pages to each containing real-world data on the cryptocurrency. I made this app because I am extremely fascinated by the world of DeFi, and figured there was a place for a no-frills user experience with the top coins that matter (of the thousands out there).
